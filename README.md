## 📘 Overview  
This short video explains how **Finite Automata (FA)** form the mathematical foundation for **text searching and pattern matching** — powering everything from simple *Ctrl + F* searches to modern compiler design and intrusion detection systems.

It covers:  
- The concept of **DFA (Deterministic Finite Automata)** and **NFA (Non-Deterministic Finite Automata)**  
- Conversion of **Regular Expressions → Finite Automata**  
- Real-world applications in **search engines**, **lexical analysis**, and **cybersecurity**  
- How automation improves efficiency in pattern detection

## 🧠 Learning Highlights  
This project helped me connect theoretical knowledge from *Theory of Computation and Compiler Design* to real-world applications.  
I understood how finite automata are not just abstract models, but are actually implemented in **text editors, search engines, and compiler lexical analyzers**.  

Creating the video improved my ability to **simplify technical content** and explain it clearly.  
It also strengthened my presentation, research, and self-learning skills — essential for both academic and professional growth.
